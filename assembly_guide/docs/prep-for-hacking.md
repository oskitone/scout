:::note
If you have no intention of ever changing the Scout's code, you can skip this part and it will work perfectly fine. But, you know, you're here, so you might as well!

## Steps

1. Solder **J2** header and **C4** (.1uF, marked 104) cap.
   - Try to get **J2**'s pins parallel to the PCB and sticking straight out.

## Test
