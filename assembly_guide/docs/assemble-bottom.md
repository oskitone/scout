## Steps

### 1. Speaker

Pop the **speaker** into its circular cavity on the **enclosure bottom** with the speaker's shiny side up.

### 2. Battery holder

Pop the **battery holder** into its cavity in the middle of the **enclosure bottom**.

### 3. PCB

Insert **PCB** onto the **enclosure bottom**, nestled into its aligners.

Orient the wires so that they're relatively contained within the space there and won't poke up into where the keys will be.

### 4. Switch clutch

Add the **switch clutch** into its spot around the switch.

This piece is vertically symmetrical, so either way is fine.
