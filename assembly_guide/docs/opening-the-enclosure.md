Later, when you need to change the batteries (or maybe just want to admire your hard work!), you'll need to open the enclosure back up.

1. Unscrew bottom **machine screws**. They don't have to come all the way out, just loosen.
2. Pop off the volume **knob**. A flathead screwdriver (or similar tool) may help provide leverage.
3. Insert that same flat tool on the UART cavity or the horizontal gap on the back right, then wedge the enclosure apart.
