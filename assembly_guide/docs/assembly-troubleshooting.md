- If the screws are hard to insert into the enclosure bottom, don't force them but look to see if the **keys mount rail** is in the way. It may have come loose from its aligners.
- Key problems
    - A note is stuck on? The key mounting screw(s) may be too tight. With the Scout turned on, try loosening the screw until the note turns off.
    - A note needs to be pushed really far down to play? Or it turns off when pressing another near it? The key mounting screw(s) may be too loose. Try tightening!
    - The speaker/battery wires can sometimes get in the way of keys, making them difficult to actuate. [Pop the enclosure apart](opening-the-enclosure.md) and see if you can make them lay flatter.
    - Most other key problems are from some obstruction between the key piece and the enclosure. Read through the ["Assemble top"](assemble-top.md#2-keys) section again and verify everything looks correct.
- If the volume knob is hard to press onto its pot shaft, don't force it -- that could permanently damage the potentiometer. Try filing the inside of the knob's shaft cavity. If printing at home, make sure you've got the most recent STL models.
