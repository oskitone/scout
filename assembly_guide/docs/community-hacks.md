## Community hacks

- **[arpeggio_hack](https://github.com/shamlian/scout/tree/arpeggio_hack) from [Steven Shamlian](https://github.com/shamlian):** Adds polyphony by arpeggiating through the held notes. The full hack requires diodes on the switches to prevent key ghosting, but otherwise the Arduino code can work w/o any hardware changes... provided you only play certain chords or don't mind the occasional wrong note. Pretty interesting!
- **[MozziScout](https://github.com/todbot/MozziScout) from [todbot](https://todbot.com/):** With some careful pin swapping on the ATmega328, the Scout can use [Mozzi](https://sensorium.github.io/Mozzi/), the popular sound synthesis library for Arduino. For this hack, it's a good idea to plug into an amplifier &mdash; the new sounds your Scout will make are much richer than what its built-in speaker is capable!
- **[2-piece Keyboard Mod](https://cults3d.com/en/3d-model/game/oskitone-scout-2-piece-keyboard-mod) from [Cyb3rn0id](https://cults3d.com/en/users/Cyb3rn0id/creations):** If your 3D printer can't easily do the color channge GCODE for the keyboard color swap, this mod splits the keys' colors into two parts that snap and glue together.
- **[Arduino Soundlab](https://www.hackster.io/john-bradnam/arduino-soundlab-bf8593) from John Bradnam:** Scout keys on a non-Scout synth? Sure! This hack swaps out the ATmega328 for an Arduino Nano and custom PCB to add FM synthesis.

## Other ideas

- For extra stability, add ruber feet to the bottom of your Scout.
