## Steps

1. Solder volume potentiometer (aka "pot") **RV1**, resistor **R3** (10k), and headphone jack **J1**.
   - A trick to get the pot to snap in better is to _gently_ push its tabs inward before popping it onto the PCB.
   - Make sure **RV1** and **J1** are pushed all the way into PCB before soldering all the way.
   - You can use a bit of tape or "Blu-Tack" adhesive to hold **J1** in place as you solder.
2. Connect your headphones into the headphone jack. _Push firmly until it clicks in all the way._

## Test

With power on, turn up the volume with the potentiometer and press **SW2**. You should hear a tone from the headphones in both the left and right channels. Power off.

If only one side of the headphones is making noise, check to see that the headphone jack is pushed all the way in.

Still working as expected? Check the [PCB troubleshooting](pcb-troubleshooting.md) section. Otherwise, continue to the next step.
