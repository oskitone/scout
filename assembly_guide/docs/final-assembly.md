With the PCB done soldering and working, it's time to finish the job! Let's put the rest together.

## Steps

### Assemble top

1. Slide **square nuts** into nut locks on **enclosure top**. It'll be snug, but they'll fit! Use needle-nose pliers or a similar tool to push them in until their holes line up with those on the enclosure.

2. Add the **keys**. Notice that 1) their rail has cavities on the sides that fit onto matching aligners on the enclosure and 2) the front of the keys have a cutout that matches an endstop on the enclosure, which will prevent the keys from being pressed too far down or being pulled up. Guide the keys down onto the aligners and into the endstop. It'll take some careful wiggling, but don't continue until they look good!

3. Glide the **keys mount rail** onto its aligners. Don't worry if it seems a little warped &mdash; it will be held flat by the screws.

### Assemble bottom

1. Pop the **speaker** into its circular cavity on the **enclosure bottom** with the speaker's shiny side up.

2. Pop the **battery holder** into its cavity in the middle of the **enclosure bottom**.

3. Insert **PCB** onto the **enclosure bottom**, nestled into its aligners.

4. Orient the wires so that they're relatively contained within the space there and won't poke up into where the keys will be.
5. Add the **switch clutch** into its spot around the switch.

### Finish

1. Align **enclosure top** onto **enclosure bottom** and snap the two halves together. Try to make sure the **keys mount rail** and **keys** stay aligned as you do this. It's an intentionally tight fit; be brave!

2. Fix **knob** onto the volume pot shaft, aligning its dimple to to the little marker on the top of the pot shaft.

3. Slide two **machine screws** up through the bottom of the **enclosure bottom**.
   - If they don't insert easily, you may have something misaligned inside. Pop the enclosure back open (see below for help) and make sure the **PCB**, **keys mount rail**, and **keys** are all lined up correctly.
   - These screws may seem unnecessary &mdash; after all, all the notes can be played and the enclosure is snapped together &mdash; but using them will cut down on mechanical "click" noises from playing. Don't skip them!
4. Cautiosly tighten **screws** on bottom but not too tight! If you overtighten, the keys will get held down.

## What's next

### Feedback

When you can, please [let me know](https://www.oskitone.com/contact) how it went for you:

- What did you like? Did you have fun?!
- Not including printing time, about how long did it take?
- Were there any parts missing or damaged?
- Any problems encountered with the instructions?
- Is there anything you'd change about the Scout itself?

I act and rely on customers' feedback to make future kits even better. Even just knowing that you got it done successfully is valuable feedback, so I do want to hear from you. Thank you so much!

### Further reading

For the curious, I've written [a blog post where you can read more about the Scout's development and history](https://blog.tommy.sh/posts/scout/).

Each Oskitone product gets it's own blog post, so dig around in there and see if there's anything else you find interesting.

### Hacking

When you're done with the hardware, the obvious next step is to play with [the software](hacking)...
