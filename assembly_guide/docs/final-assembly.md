You're almost done! Take your time to follow the directions in order.

## Steps

### 1. Snap enclosure together

Align **enclosure top** onto **enclosure bottom** and snap the two halves together. Try to make sure the **keys mount rail** and **keys** stay aligned as you do this. It's an intentionally tight fit; be brave!

### 2. Add knob

Fix **knob** onto the volume pot shaft, aligning its dimple to to the little marker on the top of the pot shaft.

### 3. Add machine screws

Slide two **machine screws** up through the bottom of the **enclosure bottom**.

- If they don't insert easily, you may have something misaligned inside. Pop the enclosure back open (see below for help) and make sure the **PCB**, **keys mount rail**, and **keys** are all lined up correctly.
- These screws may seem unnecessary &mdash; after all, all the notes can be played and the enclosure is snapped together &mdash; but using them will cut down on mechanical "click" noises from playing. Don't skip them!

### 4. Tighten screws

Cautiosly tighten **screws** on bottom but not too tight! If you overtighten, the keys will get held down.

## What's next

### Feedback

When you can, please [let me know](https://www.oskitone.com/contact) how it went for you:

- What did you like? Did you have fun?!
- Not including printing time, about how long did it take?
- Were there any parts missing or damaged?
- Any problems encountered with the instructions?
- Is there anything you'd change about the Scout itself?

I act and rely on customers' feedback to make future kits even better. Even just knowing that you got it done successfully is valuable feedback, so I do want to hear from you. Thank you so much!

### Share your make

Like your Scout? I'd love to have you share that!

* If you 3D-printed it at home, share your make on the [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4933700) or [PrusaPrinters](https://www.prusaprinters.org/prints/76472-scout-synth) page where you downloaded the models. It's a good signal to other potential makers to see successful makes.
* Tell your friends, post on social, etc. You know the deal!

### Further reading

For the curious, I've written [a blog post where you can read more about the Scout's development and history](https://blog.tommy.sh/posts/scout/).

Each Oskitone product gets it's own blog post, so dig around in there and see if there's anything else you find interesting.

### Hacking

When you're done with the hardware, the obvious next step is to play with [the software](hacking)...
