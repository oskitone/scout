With the PCB done soldering and working, it's time to finish the job! Let's put the rest together, and we'll start with the top.

## Steps

### 1. Nuts

Slide **square nuts** into nut locks on **enclosure top**. It'll be snug, but they'll fit! Use needle-nose pliers or a similar tool to push them in until their holes line up with those on the enclosure.

### 2. Keys

Add the **keys**. Notice that 1) their rail has cavities on the sides that fit onto matching aligners on the enclosure and 2) the front of the keys have a cutout that matches an endstop on the enclosure, which will prevent the keys from being pressed too far down or being pulled up. Guide the keys down onto the aligners and into the endstop. It'll take some careful wiggling, but don't continue until they look good!

### 3. Keys mount rail

Glide the **keys mount rail** onto its aligners. Don't worry if it seems a little warped &mdash; it will be held flat by the screws.
