With the PCB done soldering and working, it's time to finish the job! Let's put the rest together, and we'll start with the top.

## Steps

### 1. Nuts

Slide **square nuts** into nut locks on **enclosure top**. It'll be snug, but they'll fit! Use needle-nose pliers or a similar tool to push them in until their holes line up with those on the enclosure.

### 2. Keys

This part can be a little tricky and is easy to mess up, so let's first take a look at a cross section of how the **keys** fit into the **enclosure top**:

Notice a couple things:

1. The front of the **keys** (on the right side of the above picture) have an endstop cavity.
2. That cavity fits onto matching endstop lip on the **enclosure top**.
3. Those two together prevent the keys from being pressed too far down or being pulled up.

Add the **keys**. Its rail has cavities on the sides that fit into matching aligners  on the **enclosure top**.

It'll take some careful wiggling, but your goal is to guide the keys down _onto the aligners and into the endstop_.

When done, view the keys from the side and confirm none of them are visibly held down. Then test that the endstop is working correctly by pushing the keys _both up and down_ &mdash; they shouldn't be able to travel too far.

Here's a video showing exactly what that looks like:

Don't move on until this looks good!

### 3. Keys mount rail

Glide the **keys mount rail** onto its aligners. Don't worry if it seems a little warped &mdash; it will be held flat by the screws.
