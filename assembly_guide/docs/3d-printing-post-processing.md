:::note
If you bought a kit with 3D-printed parts included, you can skip this section, but do [open up the enclosure](opening-the-enclosure.md) and confirm you have all the right pieces ready before continuing.
:::

As a reminder, you should have seven new prints. From top to bottom:

* knob
* enclosure top
* keys
* keys mount rail
* battery holder
* switch clutch
* enclosure bottom

## Post-processing

The **enclosure top** and **switch clutch** pieces both have print supports, highlighted here:

![Built-in print supports on the Scout's enclosure top and switch clutch pieces](/img/print_supports.gif)

1. Snap off supports
2. Use a utility knife to trim off any excess plastic on the **enclosure top**

## Test fit before soldering

:::note
Optional, but it's a good idea to confirm the printed pieces are sized correctly now rather than after you're done soldering!
:::

Try as many of these as you have patience for. All should be tight fits, doable with just your hands and without any pliers or other tools. (Take a sneak peek at the [Final Assembly](final-assembly.md) step if any are unclear.)

* Insert volume potentiometer shaft into its **knob**'s cavity.
* Pop the speaker into its circular cavity on the **enclosure bottom**.
* Glide the keys mount rail onto its aligners on the **enclosure top**.
* Try snapping the two **enclosure** halves together. It's an intentionally tight fit; be brave!

If any pieces don't fit, verify the printed dimensions match what you expected as visualized in your slicing program. Revisit the slicing information in the [3D-Printing Parts and Slicing](3d-printing-parts-and-slicing.md) section.
