:::note
Take your time and make sure the switches are perfectly flat against the PCB before soldering all of their pins.
:::

## Steps

1. Solder the remaining tactile 16 switches, **SW3** through **SW18**.

We want them all as flat against the PCB as **SW2**, so take your time here and verify as you go. When done, they should all line up _perfectly_.

If they don't line up perfectly as pictured above, you'll have problems later with some notes playing accidentally when the enclosure snaps together.

## Test

Power on and press each. They should all play different notes out of the speaker. See if you can play a little tune! Power off.

Not working as expected? Check the [PCB troubleshooting](pcb-troubleshooting.md) section. Otherwise, continue to the next step.
